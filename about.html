<p>I have always been interested in electronic technology. I went to school and got an associate degree. I started working on repairing computers, video games, and networking system, but always wanted to know about programming; what makes computers and games work. I couldn’t afford to pay for a four years college, so I didn’t act on it.  I tried reading books about how to program, but life got in the way, so I stopped.  However, the curiosity of learning the skills of programming is still with me. 
<br />My renewed interest in learning the skills of programming is in the realization that technology is running our lives; in fact, virtual communications, and virtual purchases, and everything in between has made technology become indispensable.  I also want to have a career in the future and what’s better than a career in tech.
<br /> People out there say becoming a Software Engineer is not an easy task, and I agree, but this will not hold me back.  I have told myself that no matter what or how I will make this happen.
<br /> Flatiron School gave me the opportunity by removing the financial burden through “ISA” and having a team to support you and pushing you to succeed. It is amazing, that is the push I needed to pursue my dreams.
<br />I know this is just the beginning of a hard and stressful path, but I feel confident and excited to face it. So, if you are reading this article because you are thinking of becoming a programmer yourself, let me tell you something, go for it!</p>
